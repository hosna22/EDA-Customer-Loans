## Introduction
Making informed lending decisions starts with understanding the data. In this project, I dive into the world of finance to uncover patterns, risks, and insights in customer loans. Through **data cleaning, visualisation, and statistical analysis**, I explore trends in loan approvals and risks, and identify anomalies in the data. The goal? To transform raw data into valuable insights that help manage risk and improve financial decision-making. 🚀
